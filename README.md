Hey there :wave:, welcome to my Github Profile. 

### Values

- **Signal > Noise** — Silence is underrated; clarity, even more so.
- **Build to Understand** — The architecture teaches more than the blueprint.
- **Default to Generosity** — Credit is infinite; give it away freely.
- **Systems > Goals** — All code is interim. Elegance is temporary.
- **Entropy Wins** — All systems drift. The trick is drifting well.
- **The Work Remembers** — Attention embeds itself in artifacts.

Pull requests welcomed. Stars are nice, but alignment matters more.
